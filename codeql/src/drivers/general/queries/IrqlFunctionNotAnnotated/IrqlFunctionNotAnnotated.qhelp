		<p>
		The function changes the IRQL and does not restore the IRQL before it exits. It should be annotated to reflect the change or the IRQL should be restored.
		</p>
	</overview>
	<recommendation>
		<p>
			This warning indicates that the following conditions are true: 
			1. The function changes the IRQL at which the driver is running. 
			2. There is at least one path through a function that does not, by function exit, restore the IRQL to the original IRQL that the driver was running at function entry.
		</p>
	</recommendation>
	<example>
		<p>
			Function which potentially raises the IRQL level but is not annotated to reflect the change.
		</p>

			else
			{
				KeRaiseIrql(DISPATCH_LEVEL, oldIrql); // Function exits at DISPATCH_LEVEL
			}

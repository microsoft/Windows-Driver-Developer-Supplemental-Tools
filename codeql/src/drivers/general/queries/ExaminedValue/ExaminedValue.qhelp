	<overview>
		<p>
			This warning indicates that the calling function is not checking the value of the specified variable, which was supplied by a function.
		</p>
	</overview>
	<recommendation>
		<p>
			Make sure to check the result of the function that is annotated with _Check_result_ or _Must_check_result.
		</p>
	</recommendation>
	<example>
		<p>
			In this example, the driver tries to acquire a mutex but does not check the return value.  This can cause a concurrency bug.
		</p>
		<sample language="c"><![CDATA[
			KeTryToAcquireGuardedMutex(&sharedMutex);
			DoDriverWork();
			]]>
		</sample>		
		<p>
			The driver should check if the mutex was successfully acquired before using it:
		</p>
		<sample language="c"><![CDATA[
			if(KeTryToAcquireGuardedMutex(&sharedMutex))
			{
				DoDriverWork();
			}
			else
			{
				// ...
			}
			]]>
		</sample>
	</example>

		<p>To reduce noise, this rule only reports violations if more than 75% of the other calls to this function have their return values checked.</p>
		<p>Note that this will still report issues if the value is only checked via ASSERTs that are compiled away at release time.</p>

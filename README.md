# Windows Driver Developer Supplemental Tools

This repository contains open-source components for supplemental use in developing device drivers for Windows, as well as driver specific [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) query suites used for the [Windows Hardware Compatibility Program](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/compatibility/). The quickstart below will get you set up to build your database and analyze your driver using CodeQL. For the full documentation, troubleshooting, and more details about the Static Tools Logo test within the WHCP Program, please visit [CodeQL and the Static Tools Logo Test](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/static-tools-and-codeql).

### For General Use

| Branch to use            | CodeQL CLI version |
|--------------------------|--------------------|
| main                     | 2.11.5             |

### For Windows Hardware Compatibility Program Use

### Windows Hardware Compatibility Program Release Version Matrix
| Release                  | Branch to use | CodeQL CLI version |
|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| Windows Server 2022      | WHCP_21H2     | 2.4.6              |
| Windows 11               | WHCP_21H2     | 2.4.6              |
| Windows 11, version 22H2 | WHCP_22H2     | 2.6.3              |

For general use, use the `main` branch along with [version 2.11.5 of the CodeQL CLI](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/releases/tag/v2.11.5).

## Quickstart

1. Create a directory where you can place the CodeQL CLI and the queries you want to use:
    ```
    D:\> mkdir codeql-home
    ```

1. Download the CodeQL CLI zip by selecting the asset associated with your OS and architecture (codeql-win64.zip, codeql-linux64.zip, etc.), then extract it to the directory you created in the previous step.

    For the WHCP Program, use the CodeQL CLI version in accordance with the table above and Windows release you are certifying for: [version 2.4.6](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/releases/tag/v2.4.6) or [version 2.6.3](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/releases/tag/v2.6.3).

    For general use with the `main` branch, use [CodeQL CLI version 2.11.5](https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/releases/tag/v2.11.5).
    

1. Clone and install the Windows Driver Developer Supplemental Tools repository which contains the CodeQL queries specific for drivers:
    ```
    D:\codeql-home\>git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-Driver-Developer-Supplemental-Tools.git
    ```
    Now you should have:
    ```
        D:/codeql-home
            |--- codeql
            |--- Windows-Driver-Developer-Supplemental-Tools
    ```

1. Verify CodeQL is installed correctly by checking the version:
    ```
    D:\codeql-home\codeql>codeql --version
    CodeQL command-line toolchain release 2.11.5.
    Copyright (C) 2019-2022 GitHub, Inc.
    Unpacked in: D:\codeql-home\codeql
        Analysis results depend critically on separately distributed query and
        extractor modules. To list modules that are visible to the toolchain,
        use 'codeql resolve qlpacks' and 'codeql resolve languages'.
    ```

1. Install CodeQL Packages using `codeql pack install`
    ```
    D:\codeql-home\codeql>codeql pack install D:\codeql-home\Windows-Driver-Developer-Supplemental-Tools\src
    ```

1. Build your CodeQL database:

    ```
    D:\codeql-home\codeql>codeql database create <path to new database> --language=cpp --source=<driver parent directory> --command=<build command or path to build file>
    ```
    Single driver example: `codeql database create D:\DriverDatabase --language=cpp --source=D:\Drivers\SingleDriver --command="msbuild /t:rebuild D:\Drivers\SingleDriver\SingleDriver.sln"`
    
    Multiple drivers example: `codeql database create D:\SampleDriversDatabase --language=cpp --source=D:\AllMyDrivers\SampleDrivers --command=D:\AllMyDrivers\SampleDrivers\BuildAllSampleDrivers.cmd`

    _(Parameters: path for your new database, language, driver source directory, build command.)_

1. Analyze your CodeQL database:
    
    CodeQL's analysis output is provided in the form of a SARIF log file. For a human readable format, drop the SARIF file into [SARIF Viewer Website](https://microsoft.github.io/sarif-web-component/). (If there are violations, they will show up. If not, the page will not update.)
    ```
    D:\codeql-home\codeql>codeql database analyze <path to database> --format=sarifv2.1.0 --output=<"path to output file".sarif> <path to query/suite to run>
    ```
    Example: `codeql database analyze D:\DriverDatabase --format=sarifv2.1.0 --output=D:\DriverAnalysis1.sarif D:\codeql-home\Windows-driver-developer-supplemental-tools\src\suites\windows_driver_mustfix.qls`

    _(Parameters: path to new database, format, output sarif file, path to CodeQL query or query suite to use in analysis.)_

    **Note**: Be sure to check the path to the suite or query you want to run, not every branch has the same file structure.

1. ***For WHCP Users Only***: Prepare to Create a Driver Verification Log (DVL):

    Before you can create a DVL, you must copy your SARIF log file to the parent directory of your driver project. You can also modify your output location in the `codeql database analyze` step in order to skip this additional step. Once you have finished this step, please refer to the continued instructions at [CodeQL and the Static Tools Logo Test, Driver Verification Log DVL Consumption of SARIF Output](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/static-tools-and-codeql#driver-verification-log-dvl-consumption-of-sarif-output).
    ```
    D:\codeql-home\codeql>copy <path to SARIF output file> <path to driver directory>
    ```
    Example: `D:\codeql-home\codeql> copy D:\DriverAnalysis1.sarif D:\Drivers\SingleDriver`

## Navigation

Windows drivers queries are in the `src/drivers` directory.

Non-driver Microsoft-specific queries provided by Microsoft are in the `src/microsoft` directory.

Query suites are located in the `src/suites` directory and contain the Must-Fix and Recommended-Fix suites used by the WHCP Program.

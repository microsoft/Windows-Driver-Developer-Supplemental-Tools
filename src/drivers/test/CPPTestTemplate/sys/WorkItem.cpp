    Abstract:

        This module contains an implementation for KWorkItem.

        A KWorkItem inherits from CRef and is reference counted.  The object 
        cannot be destroyed until all references are released.  This includes
        the reference held when the workitem is in flight.  This allows you 
        to store the workitem in an object that has a lifecycle shorter than
        the parent device object.

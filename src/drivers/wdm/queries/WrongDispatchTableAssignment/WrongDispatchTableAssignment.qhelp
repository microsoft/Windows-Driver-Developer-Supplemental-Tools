	<overview>
		<p>
			The dispatch table assignment satisfies any of these 3 scenarios: 1) The dispatch table assignment has a function whose type is not DRIVER_DISPATCH, or 2) The dispatch table assignment has a DRIVER_DISPATCH function at its right-hand side but the function doesn't have a driver dispatch type annotation, or 3) The dispatch function satisfies both of the above conditions but its dispatch type doesn't match the expected type for the dispatch table entry.	</p>
	</overview>
	<recommendation>
		<p>
			This defect can be corrected either using a DRIVER_DISPATCH type function or by adding a _Dispatch_type_ annotation to the function or correcting the dispatch table entry being used.
		</p>
	</recommendation>
	<example>
		<p>
			In this example, the driver has a DRIVER_DISPATCH routine that is not annotated with the type(s) of IRP it handles.
		</p>
		<sample language="c"><![CDATA[
			DRIVER_DISPATCH SampleCreate;
			...
			pDo->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_CREATE] = SampleCreate;
			]]>
		</sample>		
		<p>
			The driver should instead annotate its dispatch routines appropriately.
		</p>
		<sample language="c"><![CDATA[
			_Dispatch_type_(IRP_MJ_CREATE) DRIVER_DISPATCH SampleCreate;
			...
			pDo->MajorFunction[IRP_MJ_CREATE] = SampleCreate;...
			]]>
		</sample>		
	</example>

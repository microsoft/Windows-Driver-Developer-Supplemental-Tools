/**
 * @name Driver alert suppression
 * @description Suppresses alerts in Windows Drivers based on Code Analysis syntax.
 * @kind alert-suppression
 * @id cpp/windows/drivers/driver-alert-suppression
 * 
 * This query is a suppression query designed to identify existing PREFast-style suppressions
 * in Windows driver code and honor them through LGTM's suppression system.  It cannot be run
 * on its own.  Instead, it should be run alongside other queries; when the code has a valid
 * suppression for a given result, the SARIF file output by the run will
 * indicate that the result was suppressed in the code.
 * 
 * Note that at this time, these suppressions are *not* taken into consideration during
 * WHCP certification by the Static Tools Logo test.

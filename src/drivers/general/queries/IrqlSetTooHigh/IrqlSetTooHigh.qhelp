		<p>
			The function has raised the IRQL to a level above what is allowed.
		</p>
	</overview>
	<recommendation>
		<p>
			A function has been annotated as having a max IRQL, but the execution of that function raises the IRQL above that maximum.  If you have applied custom IRQL annotations to your own functions, confirm that they are accurate.
		</p>
	</recommendation>
	<example>
		<p>
			In this example, the driver tries to raise the IRQL to HIGH_LEVEL while in a dispatch routine.  This should be avoided.
		</p>

			// Within a dispatch routine

		<p>This query may provide false positives in cases where functions are not annotated with their expected IRQL ranges or behaviors.</p>

# Use of deprecated function or macro (C28719, C28726, C28735, C28750)
Deprecated, insecure APIs should not be used.


## Recommendation
Instead of using deprecated APIs, driver developers should refer to the output of the rule and replace any calls to deprecated APIs with the recommended replacements. These recommendations are based on the MSDN articles for Code Analysis rules C28719, C28726, C28735, and C28750, as linked in the references section below. If no recommended replacement is provided, developers should investigate alternate code or APIs for attaining the same functionality.

Auto-generated WPP TMH headers are likely to flag this rule due to use of tracing APIs that are no longer meant for public use but are safely used in autogenerated code. These results can be ignored.


## Example
The driver attempts to call a deprecated string function:

```c

			void example_func(PSTR src) 
			{ 
				char dst[100]; 
				strcpy(dst, src);
			}
			
		
```
The driver should use a supported newer function:

```c

			void example_func(PSTR src) 
			{ 
				char dst[100]; 
				strcpy_s(dst, sizeof(dst), src); 
			}
			
		
```
